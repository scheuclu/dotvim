" Welcome to Vim (http://go/vim).

" If you see this file, your homedir was just created on this workstation.
" That means either you are new to Google (in that case, welcome!) or you
" got yourself a faster machine.
" Either way, the main goal of this configuration is to help you be more
" productive; if you have ideas, praise or complaints, direct them to
" vi-users@google.com (http://g/vi-users). We'd especially like to hear from you
" if you can think of ways to make this configuration better for the next
" Noogler.

" All of your plugins must be added before the following line.
" See go/vim-plugin-manager if you need help picking a plugin manager and
" setting it up.

" Enable file type based indent configuration and syntax highlighting.
" Note that when code is pasted via the terminal, vim by default does not detect
" that the code is pasted (as opposed to when using vim's paste mappings), which
" leads to incorrect indentation when indent mode is on.
" To work around this, use ":set paste" / ":set nopaste" to toggle paste mode.
" You can also use a plugin to:
" - enter insert mode with paste (https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired)
" - auto-detect pasting (https://github.com/ConradIrwin/vim-bracketed-paste)
